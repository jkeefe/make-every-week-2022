# Make Every Week returns

The last two years have been rough. And as 2021 ended, and a new coronavirus surge began, the outlook isnt exactly sunny. 

To stay centered and battle the blues, my soothing practice is making things. 

Back in 2015, I tried to [make something every week for a year](https://johnkeefe.net/make-every-week-begets-a-book). And even though I really only made something every 1.7 weeks, it was so much successful fun.

So for 2022, I'm doing it again: Make something every week. 

Might be a gadget, might be a toy, might be a map, might be bread. I'll aim to learn something in the process, and will share it here.

But make. Every week.

## A 3D-printed flexi-dog

To kick things off I literally dusted off my [3D printer](https://johnkeefe.net/printing-a-pumpkin), which I set aside when we got a pandemic puppy.

First I found the [Flexi Dog](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2810483/files) on Thingiverse, and downloaded the `.stl` file.

Then I had to remember how to use [PrusaSlicer](https://www.prusa3d.com/page/prusaslicer_424/) to turn the object into printable slices ...


... and [OctoPrint](https://octoprint.org/download/) to actually print the dog.

It didn't work right away; the triangle at the end of the tail — in the foreground of the next picture — kept coming off the base platter during printing, leading to tangled plastic messes.

After a few false starts, and two hours of printing, I had my first "make" of 2022.
